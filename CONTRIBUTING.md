# Contributing to Tessellate

We follow the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) development model in which feature branches are creating and merged back to master after testing. The contents of master is always deployable.

### Fork the project, then clone your repo

First [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the project to create your own remote copy, then fork your repo to start making changes locally.

### Create a feature branch

*Always* branch off master for new features.

```
git checkout -b mydescriptivebranchname
```

### Edit and build the code

The [README](README.md) explains how to install the necessary packages to set up the development environment.

### Commit your changes

Always write descriptive commit messages.

### Test your changes

How does the output of your copy of the project compare to master? Send screen shots and be sure to unit test the changes you've made.

### Push your changes

Push changes to your repo and send a [pull request](https://github.com/Tessellate3D/tessellate/compare) in to have your code reviewed, and hopefully merged into master.
